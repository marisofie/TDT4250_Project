# TDT4250 Semester Project ðŸ’¾
*Semester project in the course [TDT4250 - Advanced Software Design](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TDT4250#tab=omEmnet) at NTNU*

*Made by: Ã…dne Karstad, Sigrid Marita Kvamme and Mari Sofie Lerfaldet*

## Short introduction to domain
In this project we model the planning of flights both from a travelplanner perspective and an airline perspective. The travelplanner can see an overview of all airlines, airports and their related flights. It can add new airports and airlines to their domain. The airlines can plan their flights. 

To model our domain we use Ecore modelling. We then create a DSL by using Sirius to create different viewpoints for travelplanners and airlines. The viewpoints are meant to be workbenches where travelplanners can adminstrate airports and airlines, while airlines can create flights. Lastly, we transform from model to text with Acceleo, where the user can see all the flights for the different airlines. The representation in Acceleo is meant for customers looking for a flight or travelplanners who are looking for flights to book for their clients.
