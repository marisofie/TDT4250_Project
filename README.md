# TDT4250 Semester Project ðŸ’¾

_Semester project in the course [TDT4250 - Advanced Software Design](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TDT4250#tab=omEmnet) at NTNU_

_Made by: Ã…dne Karstad, Sigrid Marita Kvamme and Mari Sofie Lerfaldet_

## Short introduction to domain

In this project we model the planning of flights both from a travel planner perspective and an airline perspective. The travel planner can see an overview of all airlines, airports and their related flights. It can add new airports and airlines to their domain. The airlines can plan their flights.

To model our domain we use Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF). We then create a DSL by using Sirius to create different viewpoints for travel planners and airlines. The viewpoints are meant to be workbenches where travel planners can adminstrate airports and airlines, while airlines can create flights. Lastly, we transform from model to text with Acceleo, where the user can see all the flights for the different airlines. The representation in Acceleo is meant for customers looking for a flight or travel planners who are looking for flights to book for their clients.

## Project overview ðŸ“¢

- tdt4250.at.acceleo.html --> Model to Text in the form of differnt html sites. [Description](./tdt4250.at.acceleo.html/README.md)
- tdt4250.at.model --> Ecore model. [Description](./tdt4250.at.model/README.md)
- tdt4250.at.model.tests --> Tests for the model. [Description](./tdt4250.at.model.tests/README.md)
- tdt4250.at.sirius.diagram --> Descriptions of the viewpoints in Sirius. [Description](./tdt4250.at.sirius.diagram/README.md)
- tdt4250.at.sirius.modelling --> Representations of the viewpoints in Sirius. [Description](./tdt4250.at.sirius.modelling/README.md)

## Getting started

Launch a new Eclipse application making sure that the following plugins are included:

- Acceleo
- Sirius
- Ecore
- JDK14
- JUnit
- Eclipse
- `tdt4250.at.model`
   - This has to be included as we have written constraints and a derived feature in Java. 
   
In the new eclipse workbrench you may now import these bundles with all implemented validation enabled.

And open up the contents of the project found in the folders to try it out.

- `tdt4250.at.acceleo.html`
- `tdt4250.at.model`
- `tdt4250.at.model.tests`
- `tdt4250.at.sirius.diagram`
- `tdt4250.at.sirius.modelling`

## Features ðŸ”¥

### User Features

- A presentable overview of all flights provided by an airline or an airport (Acceleo html).
- Creation of flights for airlines (Sirius workbench).
- Creation of airlines and airports to domain for travel planners (Sirius workbench).

### Technical Features

- Modelling using Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF)
  - Constraints implemented by using both Ecore and OCL
- Model to Text transformation using Acceleo
- DSL using Sirius, to create interactive workbenches for travel planners and airlines.

## Learning objectives

- Modelling a complex domain
  - Airplane travel
- Create a domain specific language using Sirius
- Transforming model to text using Acceleo
  - M2T --> display the flights for the customers
